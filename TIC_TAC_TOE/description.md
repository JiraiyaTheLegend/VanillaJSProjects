Well for the most part I copied the architecture from a tutorial project to learn but in future 
I will add an update by myself with the feature to play with a bot or with your friends and also 
there will be a scoreboard (where they can choose to do beset of 3 or best of 5 or 7 and just like that) 
and the players should be able to choose custom symbols or emoji as their play icon.
