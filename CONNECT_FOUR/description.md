I have made the code fully but I don't understand much of it , it is loosely working and has a few bugs , some of the code is working illogically

I need to learn more about JS and it's flaws and bugs and also watch the structure of other people's connect 4 game.



Crucial update -- Fix all the bugs give proper colors , fix all the code with understandable logic and maybe adding animation and making the game 
more interactive.


* Future updates :: Adding bot , Adding scoreboard , adding special winning animation , maybe adding online gameplay.
